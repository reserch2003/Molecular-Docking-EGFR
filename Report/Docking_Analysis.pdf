The docking analysis revealed that Gefitinib interacts with key residues within the ATP-binding pockets of EGFR. A hydrogen bond was observed between Gefitinib and Met793 (distance~3.2Angstrom).
Addotionally, Phe795 participated in pi-pi stacking interactions with the aromatic ring of Gefitinib. Hybrophobic interaction were observed with Leu718 and Val726, contributing to the stabilization of the ligand within the binding site.
